        Saniah Cortez is motivated and dependable high school student with a strong work ethic and a passion for
        technology.
        Currently employed at In-N-Out Burger, where she has gained experience in customer service, teamwork, and time
        management in a fast-paced environment. She has completed some college-level coursework through dual
        enrollment, including introductory computer science classes, and has a growing foundation in programming
        languages such as Python and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p class="p1">
        Saniah is a hardworking high school senior who balances her passion for programming with a part-time job at
        In-N-Out and college-level courses. Despite her busy schedule, she remains determined and driven, always seeking
        to learn more and improve her skills. Sophie has a foundation in programming, having started with basic coding
        languages like Python and HTML during her freshman year. While she's only a few projects into her journey, her
        curiosity and enthusiasm for technology push her to constantly experiment and challenge herself.

        When she’s not working behind the counter at In-N-Out or attending classes at the local community college,
        Sophie spends her free time coding, learning new programming techniques, and exploring ways to combine her love
        of technology with her real-world experiences. Her job has taught her time management, teamwork, and
        perseverance, while her college classes give her a taste of what her future in tech could look like. Sophie
        dreams of majoring in computer science and eventually building apps or software that make a positive impact on
        people's lives. Her balance of school, work, and programming keeps her motivated as she moves closer to her
        goals.
